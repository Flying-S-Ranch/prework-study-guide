# Bootcamp Pre-work Webpage

## Description

This simple webpage allows bootcamp students to learn basic facts about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. As the developer, this project gave me hands-on experience in these basic and vital skills. The design of the webpage allows boot camp students to easily access a bullet-list of facts without searching through overwhelming amounts of information. Through the process of creating this simple webpage, I learned how to write code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, how to move changes on a branch into the main repository, and how to access the code from a website using Chrome's Inspector feature.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

On the main webpage, the information is organized into four main sections. Learn more about each of the heading subjects by reading the bullet points underneath.

To see a JavaScript function in action, access Chrome's 'Inspector' feature and choose the Console tab. The code lists the topics of study and suggests where to begin. By refreshing the webpage, the suggestion will change.
